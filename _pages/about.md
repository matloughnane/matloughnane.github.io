I'm a developer with [Caped Koala Studios](https://capedkoala.com) and freelance with [Hexa Studios](https://hexastudios.co) building mobile games, apps and websites.

I've put together this blog to capture my different coding projects and cool photos from my travels.

Over the course of 2020 I started taking on cooking and baking and challenges and wanted to capture all the tested recipes in one place. 

This website is built using **Memoirs Jekyll theme**. You can get it from Bootstrapper below.
