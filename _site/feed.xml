	make that data available on your iOS or Android devices.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	This app was developed using Arranmore Island Community Council Weather Station data powered by Three Ireland and
	supplemented with OpenWeather forecast data. It's part of Three Ireland's larger 'Most Connected Island' campaign
	and also made a dashboard available with the data graphed and charted.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/app/arranmore-weather/Artboard2-opt.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Arranmore Weather App&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The app is designed to give you all the information about the current weather as quickly and as simply as possible.
	The design will change throughout the day based on the time of day only - but the small landscape at the bottom only
	shows Arranmore under beautiful conditions. Don't expect hurricanes to appear in the app.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/app/arranmore-weather/android-tab1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Arranmore Weather App&quot;&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/app/arranmore-weather/ios1.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Arranmore Weather App&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The forecast data comes from the Open Weather API - they're a reliable service who's nearest weather station is
	based in Dungloe and will give an accurate forecast for the next 10 days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/app/arranmore-weather/ios2.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Arranmore Weather App&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The weather data in the app is straight from the weather station and shows the last 30 days of information
	collected.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the top you'll find highest piece of information on record highlighted. The data has 6 types: Wind Speed, Wind
	Direction, Humidity, Temperature, Rainfall and Solar Radiation.
&lt;/p&gt;

	case anyone wanted to use it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Online Version&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	The game is available online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://matloughnane.github.io/family-fortune-game/&quot;&gt;https://matloughnane.github.io/family-fortune-game/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The answers for the game (should only be read by the 'host') are here:
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/matloughnane/family-fortune-game/blob/master/assets/js/data.js&quot;&gt;https://github.com/matloughnane/family-fortune-game/blob/master/assets/js/data.js&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The easiest way we've found to play the game was to share the website on screen and have the host view the answers
	file on another.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If a player get's an answer correct, the host can click the answer or the corresponding number on their keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If a player get's it wrong, the host can click the wrong button or click the &quot;x&quot; key on their keyboard.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If all 3 wrong answers are exhausted they can reset the wrong answer counter with the other red button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

	present from him, the result - a mobile adventure with Owen, the Boy wonder at the centre.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I designed the game to look as much like comic book as I could while integrating into a classic 2D platformer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the artwork was hand drawn with a digital tablet (with many iterations - drawing is hard) inspired by the style
	of the JL8 comic by Yale Stewart and the platformer, Hollow Knight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;img-fluid&quot; src=&quot;/img/games/aotbw/android3.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Gameplay&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	In order to gift the present the game to Owen I spun up a quick website using a GatsbyJS theme at
	&lt;a href=&quot;https://adventuresoftheboywonder.com&quot;&gt;adventuresoftheboywonder.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

	There's some of the initial artwork there including my very poor attempt at creating a sprite sheet for an idle
	animation before moving to a skeletal animation player.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Available for Download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is available for download now on Android and iOS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we head into the Christmas season we wanted to make sure our apps was up to date so everyone can catch their favourite ferry service during the festive season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both apps have been updated to include a snowy scene on the dashboard and it'll . continue to snow until the new decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However if you're a bit of a grinch and don't like the new snow, you can check the settings page and find a small switch to turn off the snow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Tory Ferry Reroutes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest non-Christmas update comes in aid of the reroute features of the Tory app. Due to the tidal nature of the Tory ferry route we want to ensure that our users are able to see that a change has been made and can act accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tables should now be clearer and we won't show empty tables when there's no ferries running. Tomorrow's times and our date picker will all show the same format too.&lt;/p&gt;
