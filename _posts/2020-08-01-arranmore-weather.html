<blockquote class="blockquote">Arranmore Island recently made their weather station data available so here's an app to
	make that data available on your iOS or Android devices.</blockquote>

<p>
	This app was developed using Arranmore Island Community Council Weather Station data powered by Three Ireland and
	supplemented with OpenWeather forecast data. It's part of Three Ireland's larger 'Most Connected Island' campaign
	and also made a dashboard available with the data graphed and charted.

<p>
	The app is designed to give you all the information about the current weather as quickly and as simply as possible.
	The design will change throughout the day based on the time of day only - but the small landscape at the bottom only
	shows Arranmore under beautiful conditions. Don't expect hurricanes to appear in the app.

<p>
	The forecast data comes from the Open Weather API - they're a reliable service who's nearest weather station is
	based in Dungloe and will give an accurate forecast for the next 10 days.

<p>
	The weather data in the app is straight from the weather station and shows the last 30 days of information
	collected.
</p>
<p>
	At the top you'll find highest piece of information on record highlighted. The data has 6 types: Wind Speed, Wind
	Direction, Humidity, Temperature, Rainfall and Solar Radiation.
