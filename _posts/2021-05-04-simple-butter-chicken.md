3. Remove the chicken from the pan and leave to rest for a minute.
4. Dice the onion and finely dice the ginger and add to the pan
5. Add the 6 cloves of sliced garlic

8. Add all the spices to the mix. Cumin (9g), Garam Masala (14g), Paprika (8g), Tumeric (10g) and cook for a further 2 minutes.
9. Add the can of tomatoes, then add the water
10. Let it simmer for 5-8 minutes until it's reduced by 30%
11. Add the chicken back to the pan - let it simmer for another 3-5 minutes
12. Add the 250ml of cream.
13. Turn off the heat and add the 28g butter - keep the curry moving to helpemulsify the butter correctly.
