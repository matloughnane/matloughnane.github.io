<blockquote class="blockquote">The Arranmore and Tory ferry apps are ready for Christmas, are you?</blockquote>

<p>As we head into the Christmas season we wanted to make sure our apps was up to date so everyone can catch their favourite ferry service during the festive season.</p>

<p>Both apps have been updated to include a snowy scene on the dashboard and it'll . continue to snow until the new decade.</p>

<p>However if you're a bit of a grinch and don't like the new snow, you can check the settings page and find a small switch to turn off the snow.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Tory Ferry Reroutes</h2>

<p>The biggest non-Christmas update comes in aid of the reroute features of the Tory app. Due to the tidal nature of the Tory ferry route we want to ensure that our users are able to see that a change has been made and can act accordingly.</p>

<p>The tables should now be clearer and we won't show empty tables when there's no ferries running. Tomorrow's times and our date picker will all show the same format too.</p>

<p>If you've got any ideas on how we can improve the app feel free to reach out to us.</p>

<p>We also wanted to take this time to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.</p>
