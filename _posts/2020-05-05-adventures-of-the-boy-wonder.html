<p>I designed the game to look as much like comic book as I could while integrating into a classic 2D platformer.</p>

<p>All the artwork was hand drawn with a digital tablet (with many iterations - drawing is hard) inspired by the style
	of the JL8 comic by Yale Stewart and the platformer, Hollow Knight.</p>

<p>
	In order to gift the present the game to Owen I spun up a quick website using a GatsbyJS theme at
	<a href="https://adventuresoftheboywonder.com">adventuresoftheboywonder.com</a>.</p>

<p>

	There's some of the initial artwork there including my very poor attempt at creating a sprite sheet for an idle
	animation before moving to a skeletal animation player.
