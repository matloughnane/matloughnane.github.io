<p>Having taken a look at the latest blogging tools, I wanted to give Jekyll a try.</p>

<p>This blog is built using a template from Black Rock Digital, found <a href="http://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's a clean simple startup blog and has easy to follow instructions.</p> 

<h2 class="section-heading">Github</h2>

<p>I'm going to continue experimenting with Github and Jekyll and run some blog posts alongside my other website, a ghost blog, <a href="https://hexastudios.co" target="_blank" >hexastudios.co</a></p>

<p>For now this will have to serve my first blog post until I have more time.</p>
