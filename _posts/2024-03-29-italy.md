In March 2024, Megan and I travelled the length of Italy via Train.

We went from Venice > Florence > Rome > Naples > Sorrento > Capri and finally Salerno.

A once in a lifetime trip filled with amazing Pizza (best was in Naples, followed closely by Venice), Pasta (best in Florence) and sweet treats (Sorrento Granitas!)
