<blockquote class="blockquote">I created a quick little game of family fortunes and wanted to share the game and code in
	case anyone wanted to use it.</blockquote>

<h3>Online Version</h3>

<p>
	The game is available online at <a href="https://matloughnane.github.io/family-fortune-game/">https://matloughnane.github.io/family-fortune-game/</a>
</p>
<p>
	The answers for the game (should only be read by the 'host') are here:
	<a href="https://github.com/matloughnane/family-fortune-game/blob/master/assets/js/data.js">https://github.com/matloughnane/family-fortune-game/blob/master/assets/js/data.js</a>
</p>
<p>
	The easiest way we've found to play the game was to share the website on screen and have the host view the answers
	file on another.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>If a player get's an answer correct, the host can click the answer or the corresponding number on their keyboard.</li>
    <li>If a player get's it wrong, the host can click the wrong button or click the "x" key on their keyboard.</li>
    <li>If all 3 wrong answers are exhausted they can reset the wrong answer counter with the other red button.</li>
</ul>
