Raspberry Ripple Loaf straight from the oven.

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (160째C Fan).
2. Cream the butter (225g) and sugar (225g) together (I usually stick the button in the microwave to soften it).
3. Add the eggs, 1 at a time and continue mixing.
4. Add the self raising flour (225g).
5. Separate the mixture into two, add the raspberry powder (3 tsp) and food colour into one.
6. Scoop the mixtures alternately and unevenly into a greased and lined 9" loaf tin. 
7. Use and spoon and lift parts of the mixtures through eachother, don't mix, you wand the colours to be separate.
7. Cook for 50 - 55 minutes.

## Drizzle Recipe
1. Blend a small amount of water and the frozen raspberries into a smooth liquid.
2. Sieve the seeds from the mixture into the icing sugar.
2. That's it.

When the loaf comes out of the over, poke several holes with your cake tester and pour the drizzle over the top as it cools.

Enjoy.
