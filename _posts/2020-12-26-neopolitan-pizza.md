Earlier this year, my sister was kind enough to send me a pizza pilgrims Do-It-Yourself kit, since then I've moved away from London but I've managed to make the dough myself. So here's the recipe for Neopolitan style pizza from the Pizza Pilgrim.

# Ingredients

Two sets of ingredients

## Dough

-   1kg ‘00’ flour with a high gluten content
-   2g fresh baker’s yeast
-   600ml cold water
-   30g table salt
    (Yields 8 bases)

## Toppings

-   Can of tomatoes
-   Garlic
-   Basil
-   Mozzarella Cheese
-   Anything else - chorizo's good.

# Method

## Dough

1. Tip the flour onto your work service and make a well in the centre.
2. Dissolve your yeast in the water and pour into the middle of the well a little at a time whilst using your hands to bring the walls of the flour in so that the water begins to thicken.
3. Once you’ve reached the consistency of custard, add the salt and bring in the rest of the flour until it comes together as a dough. Knead for 10–15 minutes.
4. Cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes before kneading again quickly for 10 seconds.
5. Divide the dough into 200g balls and leave to rest overnight or for at least 8 hours (24 hours is optimal, 48 hours maximum)
6. in a sealed container or a deep baking dish sprinkled with flour and covered in cling film.
   
(Remember to leave space for each of your dough balls because, as the gluten relaxes, they will spread out to take up twice the diameter that they do initially.)

## Pizza

2. Make the sauce by blending the can of tomatoes and garlic together
3. Take the dough and work it on the back of your hands to a large pizza base.

8. Add the rest of your toppings to the pizza dough and move it to the grill.
9. It'll cook in a few minutes under the grill - keep an eye on it.
