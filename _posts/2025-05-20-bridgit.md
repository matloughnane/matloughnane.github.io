I've been working on Bridgit - a Charities iPaaS - and it's just launched in beta.

In fact Bridgit already had a fully self serve customer!

One of the last major features to be implemented since Bridgit launched was Bridge editing. It's still an early UX that will continue to evolve but it works well and our early customers understand it without too much prompting.

I'm looking forward to sharing more with Bridgit later this year. Stay tuned to [hibridgit.com](https://hibridgit.com) for more information.
