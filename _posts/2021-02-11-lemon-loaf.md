Lemon loaf straight from the oven.

# Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180째C (160째C Fan).
2. Cream the butter (225g) and sugar (225g) together (I usually stick the button in the microwave to soften it).
3. Add the eggs, 1 at a time and continue mixing.
4. Add the self raising flour (225g).
5. Add the whole zest of the lemon to the batter.
6. Pour the mixture into a greased and lined 9" loaf tin.
7. Cook for 50 - 55 minutes.

## Drizzle Recipe
1. Combine the juice of your lemon with 85g sifted icing sugar.
2. That's it.

When the loaf comes out of the over, poke several holes with your cake tester and pour the drizzle over the top as it cools.

Enjoy.
