We're very excited to announce the launch of Inis Oírr Beo, a mobile app for islanders and visitors to share and discover the island of Inis Oírr.

# Inis Oírr Beo

The [Inis Oírr Beo](https://inisoirrbeo.com) mobile application is an Android and iOS app designed and developed on the island of Inis Oírr with three purposes: How do we make it simple for people, islanders and visitors alike, to discover what’s happening, on Inis Oírr, to promote the Irish language using the latest technology both written and audio and to develop a unified brand across the island? So, here it is, a mobile app chock-filled with pages from your favourite, the smallest of the Aran Islands.

We’ve got pages for all the island’s businesses, their opening times, products, photos and latest events. Search for what you want on the island map, using QR codes or just check the island calendar.

Download the app today whether you’re on the island, planning to visit or admiring from afar!

We hope the Inis Oírr Beo app answers the questions:
- Things to do on Inis Oírr?
- Where to stay and eat on Inis Oírr
- Interesting places to see on Inis Oírr?
- Who We Are?

This app is a result of a joint effort between Inis Oírr’s community groups and has been funded by BIM (Bord Iascaigh Mhara) and Pleanáil Teanga Inis Oírr.
- Comhar Chomhán Teo
- CLEAS
- Pleanáil Teanga Inis Oírr

## Thank You

A little over a year ago, I [visited](https://hexastudios.co/blog/inis-oirr-seo-arainnmhor) the island of Inis Oírr to share the idea and finished product of the [Seo Árainn Mhór](https://hexastudios.co/blog/seo-arainnmhor) mobile app. Since then a committee has sprung up (and particularly in the last couple of weeks) been working to fill the app with great content, amazing photography and helping me find bugs!

Thank you to everyone on the committee for ensuring the success of this project, in particular Áine and Chloe who first reached out to me and have shepherded this project to where it is today.

AND - **thank you** to everyone who has used the app, created pages, listened to me complain about strange code and provide feedback, help and advice as this app has been in development. It makes my job all the more rewarding when I'm able to share the ups (and downs) with you all.
