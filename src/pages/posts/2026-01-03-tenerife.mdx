New Year's 2026 in the sun. Swapped the cold for Tenerife and it didn't disappoint, except the first day when it poured. Highlights were [Daria's Bakery](https://maps.app.goo.gl/s3JKQ6UU2L7YC7Vk9) for pastries and [Bank Steakhouse](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1eS7SZvmEJ9zEfbH7) for a serious steak dinner.
