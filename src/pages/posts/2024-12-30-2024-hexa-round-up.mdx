2024 was the first full year that I was working for myself as Hexa Studios and I loved the challenges of running my own business, picking up new projects and the variety of works people reached out to me for. Here's a run down of the Hexa Studios' 2024!

# Arranmore Ferry - New Admin, Promo Codes

The [Arranmore Ferry](https://thearranmoreferry.com) saw updates to their entire platform this year, from the [self service kiosk](https://thearranmoreferry.com/arranmore-ferry-blog/arranmore-ferry-self-service-kiosk) to their Point of Sale (POS devices), each component of the platform saw major updates to make them easier to use and fully integrated with the teams day to day use.

# Yoga With Maura

Hot on the heels of [her run-in with Alan Sugar](https://goss.ie/showbiz/irish-social-media-star-joins-the-cast-of-bbcs-the-apprentice-366504), Maura of [Yoga With Maura](https://yogawithmaura.ie) reached out to build and updated UX for her online yoga studio. We had a lot of fun [playing around with ideas](https://www.hexastudios.co/blog/yoga-with-maura-calendar-update) and settled on big 'calming' round corners, great typography and a simple colour palette to make it as easy for Maura and her Yogi's to join her community in her daily yoga classes.

# Inis Oírr Beo

April 2024 marked the launch of Inis Oírr Beo, a brand new community application for the islanders and visitors of Inis Oírr, one of the Arran Islands in Co. Galway. We launched on [Inis Oírr Beo](https://inisoirrbeo.com) with the incredible support of the local community and a committee made up of a volunteers.

</div>


The app features, every community project, business, landmark and enterprise with contact details, opening times, audio introduction, photos and updated page lists.
The app allows islanders to receive notifications to pages they've subscribed to and will give directions for any visitors using the built in maps functionality. It was designed to help islanders and visitors equally, I think we've catered to both user groups equally well, we're delighted with the result!

We nearly forgot the best part, the entire application is available in Gaeilge!

The response has been incredible (we've seen over 1700 downloads across Android and iOS) and the app is used in ways we hadn't even dreamed up. A huge thank you is owed to community groups and has been funded by BIM (Bord Iascaigh Mhara) and Pleanáil Teanga Inis Oírr.

# Seo Árainn Mhór: All Islands and JBH

The Seo Árainn Mhór app has become the go-to platform for keeping up with key events on Arranmore Island, and June 2024 was no exception. Over the June Bank Holiday weekend, the island was abuzz with excitement as it hosted the All-Island GAA Football Tournament, a thrilling showcase of talent, teamwork, and island spirit.

The app provided live updates, match schedules, and team results, ensuring that locals and visitors alike could stay informed about every play and goal. Its real-time updates meant that even those unable to attend the matches could follow the action from wherever they were.

# New Open Source Package 

This year, I had the chance to release the [progress_bar_countdown](https://pub.dev/packages/progress_bar_countdown) Flutter package, and it’s been incredible to see how developers have embraced it. The package makes creating countdown timers with a progress bar effortless. 

I designed it to be highly customizable, offering options like left-to-right or right-to-left progress directions and fully adjustable styles to suit any app’s design. It’s lightweight yet powerful, with features like start, pause, resume, and reset functionality and customisation for shaders, text colour schemes. It even got accepted to the brilliant [Flutter Gems website](https://fluttergems.dev)

Whether for quizzes, workout apps, or productivity tools, it’s been rewarding to see it helping others build engaging, time-sensitive experiences. I've wanted to contribute something useful to the open source community for a while, here it is and it's definitely a highlight of my year!

# Designing the Weldworx logo 

Kevin from Weldworx reached out to me in 2024 too - asking for a logo for his welding company Weldworx. It was fun to play about with a few concepts with him before ultimately settling on this logo which combined a welders mask into the Weldworx "O". I'm looking forward to working with Kevin again in 2025 as his business expands.

# MTU Talk and Upcoming Project 

I closed the year out with a talk with MA students from Munster Technological University (MTU) about the E-Learning and how my experiences with e-learning games has shaped the way I approach all applications and the development process. I've done a few of these kinds of talks now and each one has a different focus as the industry shifts, I closed the talk with a mention of how AI, while looming over developers can also be a useful tool!

# Thank You

It's been a fantastic year for me personally (did I mention I got married!) and professionally (the first year as my own boss!), so I wanted to take the time thank everyone I've worked with over 2024 and I'm very much looking forward to sharing more work with you all in 2025!
