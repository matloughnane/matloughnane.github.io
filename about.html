<p>I'm a London based software developer working on projects ranging from Websites, Mobile Apps to Alexa Skills!</p>

<p>Occasionally I take photos of my trainers on my travels for <a href="https://instagram.com/matloughnane" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>

<p class="mb-5">I've pushed this small blog live to experiment with Jekyll tech and Github Pages hosting, so far it's been fun, we'll see how long it lasts :D</p>
